        <p class="overview"> 
            According to the United Nations, more than eleven million people have left their homes in Ukraine so far: 5.3 million of which have left to neighbouring countries, while 6.5 million people are now internally displaced in the country itself amidst the continuation of the war. The UN's children agency believes that two-thirds of all Ukrainian kids have been impacted and have had to flee their homes.

            <strong>We need your ongoing support to provide food to the most vulnerable people inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, especially those on the move in search of safety.</strong>
            <br><br>
            In the worst affected areas, there are reports of severe shortages of food and drinking water.  Children and women trying to flee the conflict are cold, hungry, and afraid. We are scaling up our operations to reach millions in Ukraine and hundreds of thousands of displaced Ukrainians in bordering countries with emergency food assistance. Conflict is driving hunger in nearly all the world's main food crises. War drives hunger, and hunger increases the chances of unrest and violence. The world cannot afford another conflict.
