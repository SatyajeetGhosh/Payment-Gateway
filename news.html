More than 7.1 million people have been internally displaced. Inside Ukraine, 15.7 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children. As war continues to ravage the country, families desperately seek safety and protection.</p>

        <p class="new">More than three months since the start of the war in Ukraine, people globally are facing a cost-of-living crisis not seen in more than a generation, with escalating price shocks in the global food, energy and fertilizer markets in a world already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Before the war, Ukraine exported on average about 6 million tons of agri-commodities monthly to countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Currently, only about 15 to 20 percent of this volume can be exported via rail, Danube river, and trucks. Also, trade risks related to Russian exports have been increasing due to sanctions by various trade partners and banks. This led to price spikes and supply chain disruptions significantly undermining food security in poor importing countries.</p>
